# G11-Computer-Science-CULMINATING
Password Manager Website

Secure storage: The website should use strong encryption to protect the user's passwords and store them on a secure server.

Auto-filling: The website should allow the user to manually copy and paste login credentials for the user on websites and apps, making it easy for the user to log in without having to manually enter their password.

Generating strong passwords: The website should have the ability to generate strong, unique passwords for the user, with options for length and character types.

Multi-user support: The website should support multiple users and allow them to share passwords securely.

Backup and recovery: The website should allow users to create and restore backups of their password data in case of data loss.

Audit: The website should have a feature that allows the user to check for weak or duplicate passwords and provide a report of vulnerabilities.

Customizable settings: The website should allow the user to customize settings such as the number of characters in a password, the type of characters, and the expiration time for passwords.

GRADE 11 COMPUTER SCIENCE - CULMINATING PROJECT
● To be done individually
● Worth 30% of your final grade.
● You cannot earn more than 100% on the culminating project.
● Your project does not need to be huge. A good project length would be roughly Assignment 2’s length.
● Remember that you have other courses that you
● Due Wednesday, January 25, 2023.
REQUEST
Create a program that uses the following
● Comments/Documentation
● Variables and constants
● Conditional statements
● Loops (conditional and/or counting loops)
● Arrays
● Array algorithms - at least 3 different ones.
● Function with return values
● Function Parameters
● String functions
● Demonstrate individual problem solving abilities.
o You could learn something and apply it from a YouTube tutorial, an online resource, or use a
textbook., Be careful not to copy an entire project from YouTube or another resource..
o It does not have to be a big concept, but the bigger the concept is and its importance to your project,
the larger its bonus value.
o New learnings are anything that you have not used previously. This means if you have had difficulties
on previous assignments, you can learn it for the culminating, and it will count as your new learning.
o Early on in the project, please discuss your new topic with Mr. Hsiung to ensure it is acceptable.
o If you are unsure of what you can learn, some learnings could include, you can find a list of topics at
https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp. Click around the site to see things you can learn about
under HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
▪ The Canvas HTML element for drawing graphics - for graphical games
▪ HTML Media - combined with JavaScript, it could be used to create your own library of
videos that you can search and sort through.
▪ JavaScript Classes - for storing information in a more organized way

Rarely demonstrates the ability to meet project goals and deadlines by managing individual
time.
Code has many errors or does not have many of the required elements.
There are lots of missing comments, documentation, user prompts.
Naming is usually improper.
Level 2 “Demonstrates Some Knowledge”

Occasionally demonstrates the ability to meet project goals and deadlines by managing
individual time.
There are missing comments, documentation, user prompts
Code has some errors or does not have some of the required elements.
Naming is occasionally improper.
Level 3 “Demonstrates Considerable Knowledge”

Demonstrates the ability to meet project goals and deadlines by managing individual time.
Good comments, documentation, user prompts, and naming.
Good use of arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions.
Program demonstrates something new but the concept is used superficially in the program.

Level 4 “Exceeds expectations”

Demonstrates the ability to meet project goals and deadlines by managing individual time.
You need to demonstrate all of the requirements listed above in Level 3.
Program demonstrates something new and it is important in the way the program is made.
